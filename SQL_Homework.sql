-- * 1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table `actor`. 
SELECT first_name, last_name 
FROM actor;


-- * 1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column `Actor Name`. 
CREATE VIEW actor_name AS 
SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(first_name, " ", last_name)) AS 'Actor Name'
FROM actor;

SELECT *
FROM actor_name;

DROP VIEW actor_name;


-- * 2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, 
-- "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
SELECT *
FROM actor
WHERE first_name = "Joe ";


-- * 2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters `GEN`:
SELECT *
FROM actor
WHERE last_name LIKE '%GEN%';


-- * 2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters `LI`. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:
SELECT *
FROM actor
WHERE last_name LIKE '%LI%'

ORDER BY last_name, first_name;


-- * 2d. Using `IN`, display the `country_id` and `country` columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:
SELECT country_id, country 
FROM country
WHERE country
IN ('Afghanistan', 'Bangladesh', 'China');


-- * 3a. Add a `middle_name` column to the table `actor`. Position it between `first_name` and `last_name`. Hint: you will need to specify the data type.
ALTER TABLE actor
ADD COLUMN middle_name VARCHAR(45) NULL AFTER first_name;

SELECT	* 
FROM actor;


-- * 3b. You realize that some of these actors have tremendously long last names. Change the data type of the `middle_name` column to `blobs`.
ALTER TABLE actor
CHANGE COLUMN middle_name middle_name BLOB NULL DEFAULT NULL ;

SELECT	* 
FROM actor;


-- * 3c. Now delete the `middle_name` column.
ALTER TABLE actor 
DROP COLUMN middle_name;

SELECT	* 
FROM actor;


-- * 4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.
SELECT DISTINCT last_name, count(last_name)
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name;


-- * 4b. List last names of actors and the number of actors who have that last name, but only for names that are shared by at least two actors
SELECT DISTINCT last_name, count(last_name)
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name
HAVING count(last_name) > 1;


-- * 4c. Oh, no! The actor `HARPO WILLIAMS` was accidentally entered in the `actor` table as `GROUCHO WILLIAMS`,
--  the name of Harpo's second cousin's husband's yoga teacher. Write a query to fix the record.
UPDATE actor 
SET first_name='HARPO' 
WHERE actor_id ='172';

    
-- * 4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing `GROUCHO` to `HARPO`. It turns out that `GROUCHO` was the correct name after all! In a single query,
--  if the first name of the actor is currently `HARPO`, change it to `GROUCHO`. Otherwise, change the first name to `MUCHO GROUCHO`, 
-- as that is exactly what the actor will be with the grievous error. BE CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE FIRST NAME OF EVERY ACTOR TO `MUCHO GROUCHO`, 
-- HOWEVER! (Hint: update the record using a unique identifier.)
UPDATE actor 
SET first_name = 
	CASE 
		WHEN first_name = 'HARPO' THEN 'GROUCHO' 
			ELSE 'MUCHO GROUCHO' 
	END
WHERE actor_id ='172';


-- * 5a. You cannot locate the schema of the `address` table. Which query would you use to re-create it? *****
SELECT *
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'address';


-- * 6a. Use `JOIN` to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables `staff` and `address`:
SELECT staff.first_name, staff.last_name, address.address
FROM staff
INNER JOIN address ON
address.address_id = staff.address_id;


-- * 6b. Use `JOIN` to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005. Use tables `staff` and `payment`. 
SELECT DISTINCT staff.first_name, staff.last_name, sum(amount)
FROM staff
INNER JOIN payment ON
staff.staff_id = payment.staff_id
GROUP BY staff.staff_id;

  	
-- * 6c. List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that film. Use tables `film_actor` and `film`. Use inner join.



  	
-- * 6d. How many copies of the film `Hunchback Impossible` exist in the inventory system?



-- * 6e. Using the tables `payment` and `customer` and the `JOIN` command, list the total paid by each customer. List the customers alphabetically by last name:
